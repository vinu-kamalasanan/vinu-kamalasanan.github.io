Shared spaces are regulation free, mixed traffic environments supporting social interactions between pedestrian, cyclist and vehicles. Even when these spaces are designed to foster safety supported by reduced traffic speeds, unforeseen collisions and priority conflicts are always an open question. While AR can be used to realise virtual pedestrian lanes and traffic signals, the change in pedestrian motion dynamics using such approaches needs to be understood. This work highlights an exploratory study to evaluate how speed and path of pedestrians are impacted when using an augmented reality based virtual traffic light interface to control collisions in pedestrian motion. To achieve this objective we analyse the motion information from controlled experiments, replicating pedestrian motion on a lane supported by a stop and go interface and including scenarios such as confronting a crossing pedestrian. Our statistical and quantitative analysis gives some early insights on pedestrian control using body worn AR sytems
