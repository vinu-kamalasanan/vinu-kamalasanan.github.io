Augmented Reality (AR) in a traffic context has mainly been used in navigation with path augmentation, focused around safely guiding the user with prior knowledge of the route and the destination. Other works are reported to warn drivers by visualizing other traffic participants or dangers, which are yet currently out of sight. However they do not cover aspects of mediating control by recommending users with actions, even when such efforts are expected to foster collaboration in a multiagent environment. To the best of our knowledge, AR has not yet been applied to visualize virtual control information, e.g. virtual lanes or signposts, notably in the context of shared spaces. Such an environment should support spatial understanding of proximate participants with adaptive augmented controls to recommend actions to each user. This paper presents a Behaviour Control with AR (BCAR) Systems based framework for control of user behaviour in a shared space via augmentation and proposes how a control logic can be part of it. A prototype implementation of the proposed framework with ARCore and unity3D has been evaluated for pedestrian behaviour control to understand its feasibility
