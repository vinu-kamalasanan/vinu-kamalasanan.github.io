I am a PhD candidate focused on augmenting visual information to influence human navigation. For this, I work with Unity, scene perception and 3D animations in my research. I have good experience with creating AR content for both MRTK applications and web based user studies. In my current research, i work with interdisciplinary collaborators (with psychologists and traffic planners e.t.c.,) resulting in publications focused on future mobility and traffic safety for vulnerable road users



Research Interests:
======
1. Motion perception for AR/MR 
1. Communicating Safety using visualisation
1. Virtually populated environments
1. Web based user studies in AR
