I am a PhD candidate focused on augmenting visual information to influence human navigation. For this, I work with Unity, scene perception and 3D animations in my research. I have good experience with creating AR content for both MRTK applications and web based user studies. In my current research, i work with interdisciplinary collaborators (with psychologists and traffic planners e.t.c.,) resulting in publications focused on future mobility and traffic safety for vulnerable road users



Research Interests:
======
1. Motion perception for AR/MR 
1. Communicating Safety using visualisation
1. Virtually populated environments
1. Web based user studies in AR 



About my PhD project
======
In my current position at the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformatics (IKG), i work under the supervision of Prof Monika Sester on "Influencing walking behaviour in Shared Spaces using AR". The objective of the work is to AR influence to enhance walking safety by visualising active and passive content. 

Active Influence
------
In this form of direct manipulation, the scene motion information is percieved using object detection and tracking algorithms. For example , after having detected walking persons in front of the Hololens, their future motion path is shown in 3D. A person seeing this information using the Hololens could then decide to walk differently.


Passive Influence
------
To control walking, this form of influence is achieved by augmenting the scene with virtual infrastructure or occulded motion information. While the presences of virtual lanes could trigger behaviours of persons to walk more predictively, the existence of otherwise occulded cyclists as moving 3D avatars prompt people to be more cautious while crossing in shared spaces.
